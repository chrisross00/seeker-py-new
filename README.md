This project was created to monitor specific subreddits for changes, and send a SMS message to a given phone number when a change is detected. This helps users catch changes faster than the Reddit iOS app will alert by default.

My specific use case was finding posts on r/MechMarket for shopping, as users would often find and reply to posts before the Reddit iOS app notified me of updates to the subreddit.

Using the Twilio and Reddit API, this app no longer works due to changes in Reddits policies.
